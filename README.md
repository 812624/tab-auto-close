## Spince Search

Spince Search is a free tool that provides enhanced search results for Google and Bing queries, with a default ranking by fewest ads.

## Background - The Ad Blocker Controvery

Millions of people have installed ad blockers because they almost always provide a much better user experience. In many situations, pop-up ads and other intrusive techniques make it impossible to navigate a site. Of course, to publishers who rely on the income of ads to cover their expenses and turn a profit, these ads are a necessary cost. In theory, if everyone used an ad blocker, ad-supported sites would not be able to exist.

What has occurred recently is a constant battle between the ad block providers and the publishers. There are now many sites that detect ad blockers and prevent the user from even seeing the content. Or now sites try to find ways to show ads even if an ad blocker is installed. It is a constant game of back and forth. 

## The Spince Search Approach

Ad revenue to the website publisher is typically a function of views * CPM (cost per thousand impressions). The smaller the number of views to the site, the less revenue the publisher recieves. Spince Search works by incentivizing the publisher to show fewer ads in order to rank higher in search results. Note that this approach does not require the publisher to show no ads.

## Usage Tips

Spince ships with a whitelist that prevents the tool from running on non-search sites. You will see the icon on the toolbar turn red when the extension is running. Clicking on the toobar icon will also a display a menu where you can choose your ranking criteria. The default rank order is by fewest ads. So the result with a number 1 indicates the result with the fewest ads.

You can also prevent a single link from being analyzed within a page. To prevent a link from being analyzed, you would click the Manage Links button from the Spince icon popup. When prompted you enter the domain name you want to manage.

As an example, suppose you want to prevent all links for the www.example.com from being analyzed. You enter this domain in the Manage Link -> Exclude Link section of the Spince popup (in the browser toolbar). Then Spince will skip over any links that have the www.example.com domain.
